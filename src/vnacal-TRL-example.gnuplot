# Plot script for vnacal-TRL-example
#
# This plot isn't as pretty as the SOLT example.  Using the transistor
# has the advantage that S12 and S21 aren't on top of each other,
# but the disadvantage that the imaginary gain going over 4 scales
# the other curves too close together into a jumble at the bottom.
# It's interesting if you zoom in, though.
