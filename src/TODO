== Misc ==

    - In vnacal_new_set_m_error, walk the added measurements and
      check for incomplete T16/U16 matrices.  This allows measurements
      and set m_error call to be done in any order while giving an
      error immediately when a conflict is detected.
      DONE

    - In vnadata_save, if saving to a .ts file, set the save type to
      Touchstone v2 instead of the currently somewhat confusing logic
      that first tries v1 then promotes to v2 if needed.  In general,
      VNADATA_FILETYPE_AUTO is always implied because load and save
      both override the type if they can determine it from the filename.
      Make this more clear in the docs -- that the type is used only if
      load/save cannot determine it, and that load sets the type to that
      of the file loaded.

    - Consider renaming El (leakage) to Ed (directivity), and Ef (forward)
      to Et (transmission tracking).  Maintain backward compatiblity in
      .vnacal files.  Is it worth changing at this point??

== New Functions ==

    - Add a new vnacal_*_parameter function that takes a vnadata_t
      and returns a matrix of parameter handles.
      DONE

    - Add a new vnacal_*_parameter function that takes a matrix
      representing a multi-port standard, a vector of gamma-el values, one
      for each port, and returns a new matrix of parameter handles with
      lengths of transmission line (possibly negative) added to each port.

      Add a new vnacal_*_parameter function that takes the parameter
      handle for a single reflect standard and a gamma-el and returns
      a new parameter handle reflecting the addition of a length of
      transmission line in front of the standard. [Only if this makes
      the API simpler - implement as front-end to the more general
      function.]

      Note that embedding interface below would be more general (but
      also a more complicated API).

    - Add embedding and de-embedding operations to vnadata:

	int vnadata_embed(const vnadata_t *dut, const vnadata_t *fixture,
		vnadata_t *vna)
	int vnadata_deembed(const vnadata_t *vna, const vnadata_t *fixture,
		vnadata_t *dut)

	where dut is s_ports x s_ports, vna is m_ports x m_ports,
	and fixture is (s_ports + m_ports) x (s_ports + m_ports) with
	VNA ports first.  Output should have same frequency vector and
	reference impedances as input.	Fixture should be interpolated
	and renormalized as necessary to remain in conjugate transpose
	with the input and output.

	Slightly separate, but we can generalize vnadata T & U parameters
	to be 2x2 matrices of matrices (would need to store the internal
	dimensions, i.e. mrows, mcolumns, srows, scolumns, likely with
	some constraints such as srows == scolumns.  For consistency,
	A, B, H & G parameters can be similarly generalized to multiple
	input ports and multiple output ports.

	There could also be vnacal analogs that work on parameter matrices
	instead of the dut and vna NPD structures.

    - Add vnacal_renormalize(const double complex *z0_vector, int z0_length)

	  that re-normalizes a calibration.  The z0_length parameter must
	  be 1, number of ports, or number of frequencies * number of
	  ports.  The function could also take optional frequency_vector
	  and frequencies to resample the given z0 values.

	  For rectangular calibrations, we can assume symmetry to
	  square them, then discard unwanted cells of the result.
	  [Make sure the result is symmetrical in this case.]

== Improvements to Documentation ==

    - Create wiki, HTML, or LaTeX documentation with more in-depth
      documentation on the theory and best practices for the library.
      For example, in calibration, explain T and U parameters with
      matrix elements and the Ts, Ti, Tx, Tm / Um, Ui, Ux, Us notation.
      Explain that the reason we do everyting in T and U parameters is
      that the system of equations becomes linear.  Whatever we use,
      though should be version controlled with the source.

      This should be versioned with the source, which rules out wiki.
      It could be in markdown, also.

== Improvements to the Examples ==

    - Add example for UXYZ, a.k.a "unknown through"
	unknown symmetrical line (S12=S21)
	3 known reflects

	Note that this example does exist in the python library built
	on top of this one.

    - Add vnacal-T16-example.c using T-MM-SS-SM-MS standards.
      Approach: generally follow the example of vnacal-TSD-example, but
      in the simulated VNA, use the M = (Ts S + Ti) (Tx S + Tm)^-1 matrix
      equation to generate the measured value, taking into account all four
      T error matrices.  Note that test-vnacal-Silvonen16 already tests this
      case and can serve as a starting point.

    - Add example for TXYZ / LXYZ
	through, 3 known reflects
	Note: this is just a generalition on SOLT.

    - Add example for LRRM
	known line, 2 unknown equal reflects, match

== Improvements to the Tests ==

    - Add a new test that tests calibration with calkit & data standards
      and with each Z0 style.

    - Make tests that invoke each of the examples.  Create expected output
      files and compare that values are approximately equal.  Be careful
      with build and source directories set to different places.


== Potential Additional New Functionality ==

    - Add a function to calculate and return the error bounds covariance
      matrix as described by the Van-hamme paper.  This gives an error
      model of the error terms.  Something that may make this more
      useful would be to then use the result to estimate the error in
      a corrected S parameter matrix.

    - Make the vnacommon functions public: remove the underscore prefix,
      vnacommon_internal.h to vnacommon.h, add man page.  If publicized,
      remove the const int i, j, k's from the interface since these have
      no effect on the API and will likely mislead the caller.

      Argument against: we could alternatively drop our matrix functions
      and use the lapacke functions instead.  Publicizing ours would force
      us to continue maintaining APIs for functions we no longer used.

    - Add frequency-dependent Z0 support to vnacal_new, vnacal.
      Complex reference impedances make sense only if you can specify
      frequency dependent values.
      DONE

    - Bring back vnacal_apply_t and related methods from the git
      history (consider renaming to vnacal_map_t to better match what
      it does and avoid confusion with the vnacal_apply functions).
      The purpose of this structure is to permit using a VNA with
      fewer ports than the DUT, and making several measurements with
      different combinations of the DUT connected to the VNA ports to
      determine the S parameters of the DUT.  When the other DUT ports
      are terminated in perfect match standards, it's relatively simple
      -- it essentially amounts to just piecing together the partial S
      parameters generated from each measurement.  A more interesting
      case, however is where the other DUT ports are terminated in
      standards that are not quite perfect, either known or unknown.
      Note that even if these imperfect standards are completely known,
      the S parameters can no longer be solved as a linear system as
      the system contains products of the unknown DUT S parameters.
      In principle, though, it should be possible to solve the system
      numerically if we're given enough measurements.

      For each measurement, to describe what each DUT port is connected
      to, we can use a port map with one entry per DUT port.  When the
      port is connected to a standard, we can use one of the constant
      VNACAL_MATCH, VNACAL_SHORT, etc. values or a value returned from
      one of the vnacal_make_*_parameter functions.  These values are
      never negative.  When a DUT port is connected to the VNA, we can
      use the negative of the VNA port number.

   - Determine what's needed to support network parameters in common
     and differential form.

   - Add noise figure support to touchstone import/export.
