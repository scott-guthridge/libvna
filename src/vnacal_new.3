.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions find error terms for vector network analyzers (VNAs)
from measurements of calibration standards.
The resulting error terms can be subsequently used to correct for
errors when measuring an unknown device under test (DUT).
.PP
The overall flow is as follows.
Begin by calling \fBvnacal_create\fP() or \fBvnacal_load\fP()
to obtain a pointer to a \fBvnacal_t\fP structure.  See \fBvnacal\fP(3).
Next, start a new calibration by calling \fBvnacal_new_alloc\fP(),
giving the error term type, dimensions of the calibration, and
the number of frequency points to be used in the calibration.
Load the calibration frequencies using \fBvnacal_new_set_frequency_vector\fP(),
and set the reference impedance using \fBvnacal_new_set_z0\fP().
Next, make measurements of calibration standards and add the results of
each using the various \fBvnacal_new_add_\fP*() functions.
Solve for the error terms using \fBvnacal_new_solve\fP().
Finally, add the resulting new calibration to the \fBvnacal_t\fP structure
using \fBvnacal_add_calibration\fP().
.PP
The library supports several types of error terms, capable of correcting
different errors.
In general, error term types with more terms correct for more errors,
but at a cost of requiring more measured standards.
The \fItype\fP parameter to \fBvnacal_new_alloc\fP() can be any of the
following values:

.in -4n
.sp
Error term types are covered in more detail below.
.PP
The \fIrows\fP and \fIcolumns\fP parameters give the dimensions of the
calibration, where \fIrows\fP is the number of VNA ports that detect
signal and \fIcolumns\fP is the number of VNA ports that transmit signal.
Usually, all VNA ports can both transmit and detect signal, and both
\fIrows\fP and \fIcolumns\fP are simply the number of VNA ports.
But some vector network analyzers, such as certain models of the N2PK
open source hardware VNA, transmit and detect signal on port 1 as usual,
but only detect signal on port 2.
For this VNA, \fIrows\fP is 2 and \fIcolumns\fP is 1.
If instead of having detect-only ports, a given VNA has some number of
transmit-only ports, it can be modeled by making \fIcolumns\fP greater
than \fIrows\fP.
In all cases, however, the low-numbered ports forming the square portion
of the matrix must be able to both transmit and detect, i.e. for the
purpose of calibration, any detect-only or transmit-only ports must be
given the highest port numbers, and the VNA cannot have both.
.\"
.SS "Error Term Types"
.PP
The following table illustrates some properties of the various error
term types.
First, there are constraints on the type imposed by the calibration
dimensions.
If the calibration has more columns than rows, T parameters must be used;
if it has more rows than columns, U or E12 parameters must be used.
Next, the actual number of error terms depends on the calibration
dimensions, shown for both the square case (\fIrows\fP = \fIcolumns\fP =
ports) and in the general rectangular case.
When the dimensions are 2x2, the number of error terms matches the number
in the calibration type name.
Finally, all T and U types contain an arbitrary term.
For example, in 2x2 T8, one of the eight terms is a free variable,
so we have to solve for only seven unknowns.
Similarly, in 2x2 T16, one variable is free and we have to solve for
only fifteen unknowns.
In the table, r is rows, c is columns and p is ports.

.IP "T8 & U8"
These types correct for directivity, reflection / transmission tracking,
and port match errors on each VNA port.
Notice from the table that these are the only types for which the number
of error terms increases proportionally to the number of VNA ports,
i.e. this correction has no inter-port terms.
At least three standards are needed to solve the 2x2 T8 or U8 calibration.
.\"
.IP "TE10 & UE10"
These types correct the same errors as T8 & U8 but also add the
off-diagonal leakage terms, i.e. leakage within the VNA from the
driving port to the detectors of the other ports.
At least three standards are needed to solve the 2x2 TE10 or UE10
calibration.
.\"
.IP "T16 & U16"
These types are a superset of TE10 & UE10, adding the remaining leakage
terms, including leakage between the ports of the device under test.
At least five standards are needed to solve the 2x2 T16 or U16
calibration.
.\"
.IP "UE14"
This type corrects the same errors as TE10 and UE10, but is stronger in
that it treats each column (driving port) as an independent calibration,
i.e. it's a columns long series of rows x 1 independent systems.
Because of this, this type is able to correct for errors in switches,
even in a switch that lies between the detectors and the device under test.
At least four standards are needed to solve the 2x2 UE14 calibration.
.\"
.IP "E12"
E12 is a generalization of classic SOLT.
Internally, the library solves the system using UE14 terms and thus
corrects for exactly the same errors as UE14, creating separate
calibrations for each column.
The difference is only in the format of the saved error terms.
In E12, the library converts the U error terms it used to solve the
systems to the more conventional E (scattering parameter) form before
saving them.
At least four standards are needed to solve the 2x2 E12 calibration.
.\"
.SS "S-Parameters of the Standards"
.PP
All \fBvnacal_new_add_\fP*() functions except for \fBvnacal_new_add_through\fP()
take one or more S-parameters describing the calibration standard.
Instead of taking complex values for the S-parameters directly, these
functions take integer values that can be either one of the predefined
constants: \fB\s-2VNACAL_MATCH\s+2\fP, \fB\s-2VNACAL_OPEN\s+2\fP,
\fB\s-2VNACAL_SHORT\s+2\fP, \fB\s-2VNACAL_ZERO\s+2\fP,
\fB\s-2VNACAL_ONE\s+2\fP; or an integer handle returned from one of the
\fBvnacal_make_\fP*\fP_parameter\fP() functions.
See \fBvnacal_parameter\fP(3).
There are two main reasons for this approach.
First, it provides a single interface for parameters that are constant
across all frequencies (e.g. -1.0 for short), and parameters that are
given at a list of frequency points.
Second, it allows for parameters to be specified as unknown \- parameters
that the library has to solve for.
.\"
.SS "Measurements"
.PP
The \fBvnacal_new_add_\fP*() functions come in pairs with one taking
separate \fIa\fP and \fIb\fP matrices, and the other, a single \fIm\fP
matrix.
If the VNA measures both the voltage leaving each port (a), and the
voltage entering each port (b), use the \fIa\fP,\fIb\fP form.
This form gives more accurate results because it corrects for variations
in signal generator output level and for errors in a switch that lies
between the signal generator and directional couplers.
If the VNA doesn't measure separate a and b parameters, then
the \fIm\fP form can be used.
Always use the same form for error correction as was used for calibration.
.PP
For T8, U8, TE10, UE10, T16 and U16 error term types, the \fIa\fP matrix
has dimensions \fIb_columns\fP x \fIb_columns\fP.
The rows of \fIa\fP represent the amount of signal leaving the respective
VNA port; the columns of \fIa\fP represent the VNA port that was nominally
driving signal when the values in the column were measured.
When \fIa\fP and \fIb\fP matrices are given with these error term types,
the library calculates the measurement matrix using
.ie t \{\
.EQ
\fIa\fP { \fIb\fP sup -1 }.
.EN
.\}
.el \{\
\fIb a\fP^-1.
.\}
For E12 and UE14 error terms, the calibration is a \fIcolumns\fP
long sequence of independent \fIrows\fP x 1 systems; therefore, \fIa\fP is
a row of 1x1 matrices, or equivalently a row vector of reference values.
Because each column is a separate system, these calibration types correct
for errors in a switch, even a switch that lies between the directional
couplers and DUT.
.PP
It's always permitted to specify the full \fIrows\fP x \fIcolumns\fP
measurement matrix representing all VNA ports, even if the associated
calibration standard has fewer ports.
This is useful for determining leakage terms in calibration types that
correct for them.
In most cases, it's also possible to give an abbreviated measurement
matrix in which the number of rows or the number of columns is equal to
the number of ports of the standard being measured.
For example, in type T8, if we're adding a reflect standard on a single
VNA port, the measurement matrix can be \fIrows\fP x \fIcolumns\fP,
1 x \fIcolumns\fP, \fIrows\fP x 1, or 1x1.
In T16, however, \fIb_columns\fP or \fIm_columns\fP must be the full
set of calibration columns, and in U16, \fIb_rows\fP or \fIm_rows\fP
must be the full set of calibration rows.
.PP
When an abbreviated measurement matrix is given, the abbreviated rows
or columns always appear in port number order, even if the ports of the
standard are mapped out of order.
For example, if the VNA has four transmit/detect ports (\fIrows\fP = 4
and \fIcolumns = 4\fP), and we're adding a 2x2 measurement matrix for a
short-open double reflect standard with \fIport1\fP=3 and \fIport2\fP=2,
the first element of the measurement matrix represents the open on VNA
port 2.
.PP
If the standard has fewer ports than the VNA, the S-parameters measured
by the unused VNA ports don't matter as long as they remain constant
over the measurement, and as long as, except for leakage, they have no
through signal to or from the ports under test.
When possible, terminate unused VNA ports with loads close to the reference
impedance to avoid adding unnecessary noise into the leakage measurements.
.\"
.SS "Starting a New Calibration"
\fBvnacal_new_alloc\fP() creates a structure of type \fBvnacal_new_t\fP
used by all of the other functions.
The \fIvcp\fP parameter is a pointer to a \fBvnacal_t\fP structure obtained
from \fBvnacal_create\fP() or \fBvnacal_load\fP().
The \fItype\fP, \fIrows\fP and \fIcolumns\fP parameters determine the
type and dimensions of error terms as described above.
The \fIfrequencies\fP parameter gives the number of frequency points in
the calibration.
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_set_frequency_vector\fP() copies a vector of
calibration frequency points into the \fBvnacal_new_t\fP structure;
\fIfrequency_vector\fP must point to a vector of non-negative and
ascending values with length equal to the \fIfrequencies\fP argument
given to \fBvnacal_new_alloc\fP().
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_set_z0\fP() sets the reference impedance for the vector
network analyzer.
If not called, the value defaults to 50 ohms.
The library assumes all VNA ports have the same reference impedance.
.\"
.SS "Adding Measured Standards"
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_add_single_reflect\fP() and
\fBvnacal_new_add_single_reflect_m\fP() add the measurement of a single
port standard with parameter handle \fIs11\fP on VNA port \fIport\fP.
See \fBvnacal_parameter\fP(3).
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_add_double_reflect\fP() and
\fBvnacal_new_add_double_reflect_m\fP() add the measurement of two
reflect standards with parameter handles \fIs11\fP and \fIs22\fP, on
VNA ports \fIport1\fP and \fIport2\fP, respectively.
The s12 and s21 parameters of the standard must be zero.
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_add_through\fP() and \fBvnacal_new_add_through_m\fP()
add the measurement of a perfect through standard (s11 = 0, s12 = 1,
s21 = 1, s22 = 0) between VNA ports \fIport1\fP and \fIport2\fP.
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_add_line\fP() and \fBvnacal_new_add_line_m\fP() add the
measurement of an arbitrary 2x2 standard on VNA ports \fIport1\fP and
\fIport2\fP.
The \fIs_2x2\fP argument is a pointer to the first element of a 2x2
matrix of parameter handles.
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_add_mapped_matrix\fP() and
\fBvnacal_new_add_mapped_matrix_m\fP() add the measurement of an arbitrary
multi-port standard.
The \fIs\fP parameter is a pointer to the first element of an \fIs_rows\fP
x \fIs_columns\fP matrix of s-parameter handles.
The \fIport_map\fP parameter is a vector of length max(\fIs_rows\fP,
\fIs_columns\fP), one entry for each DUT port, containing VNA port
numbers, describing which VNA ports are connected to the respective
ports of the standard.
It may be \s-2NULL\s+2 if the number of VNA ports is equal to the
number of ports of the standard and the ports are connected in order.
.\"
.SS "Solving for the Error Terms"
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_solve\fP() uses the added measurements to solve for
the error terms.  It returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
After calling \fBvnacal_new_solve\fP(), it is permitted to add additional
measurements and repeat the call, for example if \fBvnacal_new_solve\fP()
fails due to an insufficient number of standards.
.\"
.SS "Cleanup"
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_free\fP() frees the \fBvnacal_t\fP structure, the contained
frequency vector, added measurements and error terms.
Note that a call to \fBvnacal_free\fP() implicitly frees all associated
\fBvnacal_new_t\fP structures; don't call \fBvnacal_new_free\fP() after
calling \fBvnacal_free\fP().
.\"
.SS "Managing Measurement Error and Tolerance"
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_set_m_error\fP() enables measurement error modeling in
\fBvnacal_new_solve\fP().
Specifying the measurement errors with this function can significantly
reduce error in the solved error terms, especially when the system of
measured standards is significantly overdetermined, as is usually the
case when using the 16 error term models.
The \fIsigma_nf_vector\fP parameter is a \fIfrequencies\fP long vector
of standard deviations of noise floor measurements at the VNA detectors
when no signal is applied.
Similarly, \fIsigma_tr_vector\fP is \fIfrequencies\fP long vector of
standard deviations describing an additional noise source, e.g. random
amplitude modulation in the signal generator, that is proportional to
the RMS amplitude of the received signal.
The later is optional and may be given as \s-2NULL\s+2.
Both noise sources are assumed to be Gaussian and i.i.d.
If both vectors are given as \s-2NULL\s+2, then measurement error
modeling is reset to disabled.
.PP
Note that when separate \fIa\fP and \fIb\fP measurements are given,
the amplitude used for scaling \fIsigma_tr_vector\fP is that after
dividing the \fIb\fP matrix by the \fIa\fP matrix.
If the \fIa\fP matrix and \fIb\fP matrix are measured simultaneously,
then amplitude modulation error in the signal source will have already
been divided out, and \fIsigma_tr_vector\fP is likely not useful.
.PP
The \fIfrequency_vector\fP parameter is a vector of ascending frequency
values where the noise measurements were made.
These frequencies don't have to align with the frequencies given in
\fBvnacal_new_set_frequency_vector\fP() \- the library uses cubic
spline interpolation as necessary \- but the frequency range must span
the entire range of calibration frequencies.
The \fBvnacal_new_set_frequency_vector\fP() function must be called
before \fBvnacal_new_set_m_error\fP().
If \fIfrequencies\fP is 1, then \fIfrequency_vector\fP is not used
and can be specified as \s-2NULL\s+2.  In this case, the single noise
values given apply to all frequencies.
If \fIfrequencies\fP is equal to the number of frequencies given in
\fBvnacal_new_set_frequency_vector\fP() and \fIfrequency_vector\fP
is \s-2NULL\s+2, then the frequency vector defaults to that given
in \fBvnacal_new_set_frequency_vector\fP().
.PP
When using \s-2VNACAL_T16\s+2 or \s-2VNACAL_U16\s+2 error term types
with measurement error modeling, the complete s-parameter matrix for
each calibration standard must be given; when not using measurement
error modeling, not all cells of these matrices are required to be
known.
.PP
When measurement error modeling is enabled, \fBvnacal_new_solve\fP()
computes a p-value giving the probability that the magnitudes of the
residuals observed are less than or equal to those expected due to random
errors, assuming that the measurements are consistent with the specifed
error model.
The \fBvnacal_new_set_pvalue_limit\fP() function sets the
\fIsignificance\fP below which the library should reject the null
hypothesis that the measurements are consistent.
In this case, \fBvnacal_new_solve\fP() returns failure.
\fIsignificance\fP must be greater than zero and no more than one.
The default is 0.001.
.PP
Some of the solve methods used in \fBvnacal_new_solve\fP() are iterative
and some are analytical.
If we're modeling measurement errors (see \fBvnacal_new_set_m_error\fP()),
the solution is always iterative.
Here, the library weights the equations such that the residuals reflect
the expected measurement errors.
The solved error terms depend on the weights, but the weights depend on
the solved error terms, thus the library iterates until these converge.
When there are unknown parameters in the calibration standards, the
solution method is usually iterative, except in the special case of
two-port TRL, which has an analytical solution.
The following functions control the iterative methods.
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_set_et_tolerance\fP() sets the degree of RMS change in
the error terms sufficiently small to stop iteration.
Similarly
\fBvnacal_new_set_p_tolerance\fP() sets the degree of RMS change in the
unknown parameters sufficiently small to stop iteration.
Both tolerances must be met before the system is considered to be converged.
The default value for both functions is 1.0e-6.
.PP
\fBvnacal_new_set_iteration_limit\fP() sets the maximum number of
iterations allowed for convergence.
If the system has still not converged by this limit, then
\fBvnacal_new_solve\fP() fails.
The default is 30.
.\"
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBvnacal_new_alloc\fP() function returns a pointer to an opaque
\fBvnacal_new_t\fP structure needed by the other functions.
All integer-valued functions return 0 on success or -1 on error.
.\"
.SH ERRORS
On error, these functions invoke the \fIerror_fn\fP, given to
